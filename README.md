Predictive maintenance of an aircraft engine


**Data description:**

Data from the data challenge competition held at the 1st international conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM08) is being made publicly available. The dataset is similar to the one posted above (see Turbofan engine degradation simulation data set) except the true RUL values are not revealed. Users are expected to develop their algorithms using training and test sets provided in the package. The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.
