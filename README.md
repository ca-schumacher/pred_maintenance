# Predicting the remaining uselful life of a turbofan engine

**September 2019**

## Introduction

**Project Description:**

We will use this dataset to analyse and predict a the remaining uselful lifespan (RUL) of a turbofan engine.

**Data description:**

Data stems from the data challenge competition held at the 1st international conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM08) is being made publicly available. It contains recorded sensor data of 21 sensors in 218 engines. Turbofans were operated for multiple cycles and with different settings. The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.
